In today's world, the importance of ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance) is widely recognized. Aily project aims to contribute to these areas by tackling waste management challenges. By automatically sorting and collecting garbage based on ESG-related keywords, Aily seeks to promote sustainable practices and minimize the impact of waste on the environment.

Aily (Ai-recycle) is a project aimed at revolutionizing the way garbage is sorted and collected. By leveraging AI (Yolov5), Aily's real hardware is capable of accurately identifying different types of garbage and automating the sorting process. This not only reduces the burden on individuals but also ensures efficient recycling practices.
